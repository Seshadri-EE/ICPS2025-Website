            <h1> About ICPS 2025 </h1>
            <p> The International Conference on Power Systems (ICPS) 2025, themed "<strong>Leveraging Smart Technologies for Clean, Resilient, and Secure Power Systems</strong>", aims to explore the transformative role of emerging technologies in shaping the future of global power systems.  As the power sector enters a new era driven by the need for enhanced sustainability, resilience, and security, ICPS will provide a unique forum for researchers, engineers, and policymakers from academia, industry, and practice to engage in thought-provoking discussions and collaborative efforts. The 11th edition of ICPS, scheduled for December 7-9, 2025, at IIT Hyderabad, India, will focus on the integration of renewable energy sources, smart grid innovations, and AI-driven solutions for grid management.</p>
            <p> ICPS serves as a leading biennial forum for experts to exchange knowledge and explore the latest developments across a wide range of power systems domains, with key tracks including Smart Grid and Power Systems, Smart Generation, Transmission & Distribution, Renewable Energy Systems, and Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics. As part of its mission to advance global collaboration, the conference will address critical issues such as grid resilience, protection, stability, optimization, and the role of emerging technologies like electric vehicles and power electronics in future power systems. </p>
            <p> On behalf of the Steering Committee and the Organizing Committee, we cordially invite you to join us in Hyderabad for ICPS 2025. With a mix of technical sessions, interactive panel discussions, and tutorials by leading experts, this conference will provide valuable opportunities for networking, learning, and collaboration. We look forward to welcoming you to this exciting event as we work together to shape the future of power systems.</p>
