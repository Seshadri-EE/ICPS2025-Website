                        <div class="speaker-abstract">
                            Electricity transmission pricing is fundamental to ensuring efficient, reliable, and equitable use of the power grid. Sound transmission pricing frameworks generally follow a set of core principles such as: cost recovery for transmission licensees, cost-causation-based allocation of charges, non-discriminatory open access, and transparent regulatory oversight. Over time, systems worldwide have evolved from simple energy-based charges to more sophisticated approaches that reflect actual network usage, distance, direction of flows, congestion, and losses. These changes aim to allocate costs fairly, send efficient economic signals, and support grid sustainability—especially as transmission networks expand and integrate large volumes of renewable energy with variable, bidirectional flows.
                            
                            In India, the transmission pricing regime has undergone a significant transformation. In the earlier decades, charges were allocated largely on simple energy-based formulas or fixed shares of central generating station outputs. The Electricity Act, 2003 catalyzed reform by promoting open access and regulatory oversight, leading to more transparent and cost-reflective pricing. The introduction of the Point of Connection (PoC) mechanism in 2011 marked a major shift toward usage- and flow-based tariff allocation for inter-state systems. Subsequent refinements in the CERC Sharing Regulations (2020) further aligned charges with grid utilization patterns. As India's grid continues to expand and integrate high levels of renewable generation, future transmission pricing is expected to become more dynamic and granular, potentially incorporating locational signals, congestion components, and marginal-cost-based principles to ensure economic efficiency and long-term grid resilience. This talk is expected to cover the above aspects of transmission pricing.

                        <div class="speaker-abstract">
                            India is the world's third largest carbon emitter and has committed to achieve net zero emissions by 2070. India is aiming to achieve installation of renewable energy of 500 GW by 2030 and over 600 GW by 2032. There are plans for expanding the existing transmission network, integration of energy storage solutions and supporting green hydrogen hubs which are identified in different states of India. The modern power system is highly interconnected with various generation sources. Monitoring, protection and control actions play very important role to help the system operator to reliably operate the grid. The system operator experiences different challenging scenarios in the contemporary power grid. The existing power system grid is well operated and controlled by well-known supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The drawbacks of the SCADA systems are poor visualization, lack of time stamping, unable to provide accurate estimate of the system states, and poor situational awareness. Therefore, the existing monitoring system is not adequate to monitor the modern power grid. On the other hand, synchrophasors are intelligent electronic devices, which normally provide synchronized voltage phasor, current phasor, frequency and rate of change of frequency measurements. Synchrophasors, also known as phasor measurment units (PMUs), are an integral part of smart grid implementation plan. Synchrophasors are installed in the generating station, HVDC system, intertie line, and interstate transmission system. Those are also installed at the renewable energy collection substations. PMU data are used for wide area monitoring, protection and control (WAMPAC).

                        <div class="speaker-abstract">
                            Digital transformation of the electric power grid is essential to accelerate open innovation with data-driven AI to support the energy transition. Yet the power grid continues to face slow innovation cycles driven by proprietary vendor ecosystems, hardware-defined grid automations, and restricted access to secure, high-quality operational data. These limitations hinder experimentation, complicate integration of advanced analytics, and reinforce long-term technology lock-in.

                            At the same time, cybersecurity risks are intensifying on the current digital implementations. Recent power-grid cyber attacks demonstrated how power substation components—including protection relays, HMIs, engineering workstations, and remote access channels—can be compromised through structured attack chains.

                            From several years of industry experience, it is proposed to build open-innovation (non-proprietary) and cyber-resilient solutions considering the use-case of IEC 61850-based digital substations. This session provides a focused examination of: (1) why adoption in digital substations remains slow; (2) where cyber vulnerabilities persist today; and (3) how real-world attack scenarios map to known adversarial techniques (explained using MITRE ATT&CK framework). The session then provides a real-world case-study on open innovation demonstration—supported by open-source frameworks (e.g., Linux Foundation Energy) for the virtualized or software-defined substation automation solutions.

                        <div class="speaker-abstract">
                            The electric power grid is undergoing an unprecedented transformation driven by the convergence of digitalization, decentralization, and decarbonization. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a pivotal enabler of this evolution, empowering utilities, and industries to achieve higher levels of reliability, efficiency, and resilience. This talk explores how AI is reshaping the architecture, operation, and management of modern power systems—spanning applications across transmission and distribution of power grids. Beyond technology, it emphasizes the evolving role of power engineers as leaders in data-driven decision-making, system modelling/analysis, and cyber-physical integration with a detailed case study on one of the key problem statements. By blending domain expertise with AI literacy, power engineers can guide the transition toward an intelligent, explainable, and responsible solutions for utilities and industries. Ultimately, it argues that the next technological transformation in the grid sector will succeed not merely through innovation in AI algorithms or technology, but through the adaptability of the power engineers along with domain skillsets who implement them.

                        <div class="speaker-abstract">
                            Power electronics converters are essential to the green energy transition. Therefore, the penetration of power converters for various applications is increasing, and they are required to meet regulatory requirements. These requirements affect the size of the active and passive components used in the converter. The first part of the tutorial addresses the requirement for the design of the converter and how it affects the selection of the passive components. These components are the main factor that decides the size, weight, and volume of the drive. They may typically contribute to 75% of the weight and volume of the converter. For these converters, the DC-link capacitor is the major contributor among the passive components. To reduce the size of converters, a reduction in the value of DC-link capacitance is an alternative. Such alternate converters can be classified as small DC-link capacitor-based power converters. The second part of the tutorial focuses on conventional power converter topologies (two-level and three-level converters) with small DC-link capacitors and related issues such as negative impedance instability and mid-point voltage balance in the three-level converter. Furthermore, the tutorial also discusses some small DC-link capacitor-based power converter topologies that utilize current injection circuits for grid-connected applications. These converters have the advantage of high efficiency and high power density. The main target audience for the tutorial is active researchers, PhD students, and working professionals from the industry in power electronics converters for electric drives. However, the topics will be presented in a way that the fundamentals can be applied to other AC-DC power converter applications as well.
