            <h2>Author and Paper Submission Guidelines</h2>
            <p>The following guidelines must be strictly adhered to while submitting your manuscript to ICPS 2025:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Language:</strong> All submissions must be in English.</li>
                <li><strong>Originality:</strong> Papers must be original and not under consideration for publication elsewhere.</li>
                <li><strong>Format:</strong> Papers must adhere to the IEEE two-column format. They should not exceed six (6) A4 pages in length. Submit papers as a PDF file (max. size: 2MB). <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html" target="_blank">Download the IEEE template here</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Plagiarism:</strong> All papers will undergo a plagiarism check. Papers with a similarity index of 15% or higher (excluding references) may be rejected without review. Check <a href="https://www.ieee.org/publications/rights/plagiarism.html" target="_blank">IEEE Plagiarism Policy</a> for more details.</li>
                <li><strong>Submission Portal:</strong> Only submissions made through the <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/icps2025" target="_blank">CMT Portal</a> will be accepted.</li>
                <li><strong>Track Selection:</strong> Choose the track that best matches the content of your paper for appropriate session scheduling and reviewer assignment. The list of tracks is available <a href="tracks.html">here</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Review Process:</strong> All submitted papers will undergo a <strong>single-blind review</strong> process.
